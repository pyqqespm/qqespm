# QQESPM
This repository contains the source code of a python implementation for the QQESPM algorithm proposed in the paper submitted to [GeoInfo](http://mtc-m16c.sid.inpe.br/ibi/8JMKD3MGPDW34P/4ADE2M8), and fully described in a JIDM scientific paper to be published.

We used a dataset of POIs from OpenStreetMap gathered with the osmnx python library, using the tags amenity, shop and tourism. The dataset extract is in the data/ folder.
